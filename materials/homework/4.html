		Create a multi-page website for a client. Ideally the client should be a friend or acquaintance you have an existing positive relationship with (as long as they are not a student in this class). Possible site ideas are a business website for a restaurant, construction firm, consulting business or a portfolio website for a musician or visual artist. If you are having difficulty finding a client please email me as soon as possible for assistance.
  </p>
  <p>The first part of this project involves research and design. You have two weeks to complete the deliverables outlined in this assignment, due by the start of class on <span class="highlight">October 17<sup>th</sup></span>. Further iterations of this project will be due throughout the semester. Additionally, you must email me (<a href="mailto:asringler@massart.edu">asringler@massart.edu</a>) the name of your client and a one or two sentence description of their business or needs by <span class="highlight">Monday October 10<sup>th</sup> @5pm</span>
  </p>

    <h2>Deliverables: Detail</h2>
    <h3>Choosing a Client</h3>
    Below are some attributes of a good client for this assignment:
    <ol>
      <li>The client will need a new website (or redesign) and does not have a deadline by which it will need to be completed</li>
      <li>The client must be able to provide any necessary content, including verbiage and imagery, when requested and in a timely fashion</li>
      <li>The client must be available for brief weekly phone calls or in-person meetings and occasional improptu consultations</li>
      <li>The client will not refrain from being honest with you (if your mother loves everything you do, she may not be a good candidate to be a client)</li>
      <li>The client does not have very “sophisticated” needs, such as heavy use of animation and interactivity, and does not need a “large” website (more than a dozen webpages)</li>
      <li>The client doesn’t need to be able to update the site themselves, or very often (in other words, they do not need a site powered by a content management system like Wordpress)</li>
      <li>The client realizes that you are a student learning web design and may not be able to complete their website to the level of completion or sophistication they desire</li>
      <li>The client is your friend</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Client</h3>
    <ul class="sections">
      <li>Recruit and meet with your client. Discuss their website, assess their desires and needs. Make sure to record or detailed take notes of your conversation. It is respectful and professional to remember in detail what has been discussed with your clients.</li>
    </ul>
    Here are some possible questions you could ask your client during your first meeting:
    <ol>
      <li>Why do you want a website?</li>
      <li>If they have an existing website why do they want a new one. What is wrong with the current website? Does it work well on mobile? Do they want a responsive design?</li>
      <li>What does your business do?</li>
      <li>What are some requirements of your site? What must exist on the site? Menus, examples of work, contact information, etc…</li>
      <li>Who do you think will be visiting your website? What types of people? Vendors, consumers, agents, recruiters, artists, clients?</li>
      <li>Can you list any websites that you really like?</li>
      <li>Are there any special features you need on your website? Audio player? Animations?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Client Site <em>Process Page</em></h3>
    <ul class="sections">
      <li>Create an HTML page that will serve as a place to post all of your interim deliverables including client meeting notes, design mockups, client needs assessment, etc… We will call this page your project's <em>Process Page</em>. As you have done with all assignments, create a link to to this page from your <i>Student Page</i>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Client Needs</h3>
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Post client meeting notes to your process page, these do not need to be formatted HTML, you could link to a .txt file for example. If you did not take notes (and only recorded the meeting with audio) please listen to your audio and type a list of all of the important points discussed.</li>
      <li>Identify the client’s needs and the needs of the client’s website visitors. Post a 500-word written essay describing these needs to your process page.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Competitive Audit, Inspiration</h3>
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Find several compelling websites of businesses related to your client. List them (as links) on your process page. List a few items your find interesting from each of these websites.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Architecture Diagram</h3>
    The purpose of an architecture diagram is to provide a clear organizational structure for the site’s content to later assist you during the building process. It also gives you a high-level overview of all of the content that will eventually go into the final website. This may be hand-drawn (photographed or scanned) or digital (Google Drawings works well).
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Create an architecture diagram of the client's website and post to your process page. It must include the linking between pages. Additionally, next to each page you must list the content available on that page or include a short description of the page.</li>
      <li>Assess the differences between your proposed features listed in your architecture diagram and those found on the competitor websites. Do you have any they don't have, or visa-versa. Make sure you can justify differences.</li>
    </ol>
        
    <h3>Sketches (Visual Layout)</h3>
    <p>Create website sketches on paper to explore the visual layout of the various pages of the website.</p>
    <p>Sketches can and should happen at any time during the design process (not just at the beginning). It can sometimes be useful to sketch ideas on paper during the initial client meeting. If the client is accustomed to viewing hand-drawn sketches, and you are able to sketch quickly enough, this can be an effective way of understanding the client's desires and needs.</p>
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Post photos or scans of your sketches to your process page</li>
    </ol>
