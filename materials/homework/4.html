		Create a multi-page website for a client. Ideally the client should be a friend you have an existing positive relationship with (as long as they are not a student in this class). Possible site ideas are a business website for a restaurant, construction firm, consulting business, a portfolio website for a musician or visual artist. You have two weeks to complete the deliverables outlined in this document, due by the start of class on <span class="highlight">October 17<sup>th</sup></span>. Further iterations of this project will be due throughout the semester.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Practice communicating with clients</li>
      <li>Practice understanding client needs and translating to web designs and actualized designs</li>
      <li>Practice communicating, justifying and promoting proposed ideas to clients</li>
      <li>Practice responding to and working with critical feedback from clients</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Choosing a Client</h2>
    Below are some attributes of a good client for this assignment:
    <ol>
      <li>The client will need a new website (or redesign) and does not have a deadline by which it will need to be completed</li>
      <li>The client must be able to provide any necessary content, including verbiage and imagery, when requested and in a timely fashion</li>
      <li>The client must be available for brief weekly phone calls or in-person meetings and occasional improptu consultations</li>
      <li>The client will not refrain from being honest with you (if your mother loves everything you do, she may not be a good candidate to be a client)</li>
      <li>The client does not have very “sophisticated” needs, such as heavy use of animation and interactivity, and does not need a “large” website (more than a dozen webpages)</li>
      <li>The client doesn’t need to be able to update the site themselves, or very often (in other words, they do not need a site powered by a content management system like Wordpress)</li>
      <li>The client realizes that you are a student learning web design and may not be able to complete their website to the level of completion or sophistication they desire</li>
      <li>The client is your friend</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>All due by the start of class on <span class="highlight">October 17<sup>th</sup></span>.</p>
    
    <h3>Client</h3>
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Recruit and meet with your client. Assess their needs and take notes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Design Process Page</h3>
    Create an HTML page that will serve as a place to post all of your interim deliverables including client meeting notes, design mockups, client needs assessment, etc… Link to this page from your student page.
    <ol class="sections">
    </ol>

    <h3>Client Needs</h3>
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Post client meeting notes to your process page, these do not need to be HTML, you could link to a .txt file for example</li>
      <li>Identify the client’s needs and the needs of the client’s website visitors. Post a 500-word written essay describing these needs to your process page.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Competitive Audit, Inspiration</h3>
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Find several websites of businesses related to your client. List them on your process page</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Architecture Diagram</h3>
    The purpose of an architecture diagram is to provide a clear organizational structure for the site’s content to later assist you during the building process.
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>Create an architecture diagram of the client's website and post to your process page. It should illustrate the linking between pages and list content available on each page.</li>
      <li>Assess the differences between your proposed features listed in your architecture diagram and those found on the competitor websites. Do you have any they don't have, or visa-versa. Make sure you can justify differences.</li>

    <h3>Sketches</h3>
    Create website sketches on paper to explore the visual layout of the various pages of the website.
