    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Practice using a variety of HTML tags in a semantic fashion</li>
      <li>Practice using basic CSS styling to influence the visual page aesthetics</li>
      <li>Practice designing site content in order to communicate information to a variety of audiences</li>
      <li>Practice using GitHub Desktop</li>
      <li>Practice editing code using the Textmate text editor</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p>A single-page event website synced to GitHub and linked to from your <i>Student Page</i>. See <a href="https://andrewringler.github.io/web1-f16-student/">andrewringler.github.io/web1-f16-student/</a> (<a href="https://github.com/andrewringler/web1-f16-student">GitHub</a>) for an example of how to do this. Should contain any information visitors to the event would need to know structured in a usable fashion.</p>
    <p>Suggested content includes (you must include at least five of the following):</p>
    
    <ol class="sections">
      <li>One or more tables with a schedule of presentations, workshops, including the day, time, location, title of presentation, and name of presenter</li>
      <li>Artist/performer biographies</li>
      <li>Description of the event</li>
      <li>Registration, cost, attendance information</li>
      <li>Directions, location of the event</li>
      <li>At least one photos or graphic (possibly from a previous year's event)</li>
      <li>A menu</li>
      <li>A footer</li>
      <li>Content separated by sections</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Minimal CSS styling including font choice, type sizes, type weight and color.</p>
    
    <h3>Fonts</h3>
    <p>A good list of fonts that are generally available on a wide range of computers are at <a href="http://www.cssfontstack.com/">CSS Font Stack</a>. If you click on a font, like <a href="http://www.cssfontstack.com/Optima">Optima</a>, it gives you a <code>font-family</code> line that you can cut-paste into your CSS. Their h1 examples looks like:
    </p>
    <code><pre>
h1 {
   font-family: Optima, Segoe, "Segoe UI", Candara, Calibri, Arial, sans-serif;
}
    </pre>
    </code>
    <p>
      This is specifying “fallbacks”, so first your browser will try to load the site with Optima, if not available, it will try Segoe, then Segoe UI, etc…. This is an opinated list of fonts that cssfontstack thoughts were similar-ish to Optima. Next week we will learn to use WebFonts, which will allow us to just provide the user with Optima if they don't have it.
