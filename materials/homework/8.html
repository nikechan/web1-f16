  <p>You will now start the last new project of the semester. It is a right of passage in all web design courses taught at art schools to create a personal portfolio website. Your task is to create a personal portfolio website to showcase your work. Just with your client website, it is important to consider why you are making a portfolio website, what you hope to achieve with it. This will help keep you focused on features that matter most as you build out your site.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Practice building a website from scratch now that you have completed several small sites.</li>
      <li>Contrast the process of building a site for yourself versus building one for a client.</li>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    Why do you need a personal portfolio? Do you want to include as a link on potentially job applications? What do you want to convey? Are you an illustrator, what types of illustrations do you make? Will you show all of your work, or just some? What story do you want to tell about yourself?
