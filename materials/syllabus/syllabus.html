    <li class="required"><b>Required:</b> <i>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</i>, Jon Duckett <a class="screenonly" href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189">amazon</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Grading</h2>
  Throughout this semester you will receive many assignments, each with various stages and parts. Students should treat all of their assignments as a single body of work in which they improve over the entire semester. Assignments deadlines are very important to keep you on track, but also, continued progress and iteration on all assignments is a vital aspect of this class that will help you grow as a web developer.
  
  <ol>
    <li><h3>40% Assignment Initial Submission</h3>
      All work is due on time and pushed to GitHub (get assignments from classmates or course website if you miss class). Expect to work at least 5 hours outside of class time per week on readings and design assignments. If you need to, spend extra time in the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor Digital Media Labs. Always be prepared to present for class review all assignments. All assignments are due by the start of class.
    </li>
    <li><h3>40% Assignment Revisions</h3>
      Web design and programming are processes that benefit from review and revision. Students should be responsive and timely to suggestions and requests for revisions from the teacher. Requests and suggestions will be made in class, via email, via assignments and via GitHub issues and pull requests.
    </li>
    <li><h3>20% Class Participation &amp; Attendance</h3>
      Students are expected to arrive on time, stay until the class is dismissed and fully participate in every class. This includes, but is not limited to, participating in class conversations, providing feedback during critiques and working respectfully during pair programming.
    </li>

  <h2>Departmental Guidelines</h2>
  <p>Refer to appropriate addendums for your major.</p>

  <h2>Attendance</h2><p>During the first week of classes, faculty state clearly their expectations for performance and attendance, their method of recording attendance, and their expectations for makeup work and examinations. All students must attend the first day of classes for which they are registered to reserve a place in the course. If a student cannot attend because of illness or other emergency, he or she must email faculty before the first class meeting to inform the faculty member of their absence. A student who misses the first meeting of a class without notice may be dropped from the roster by the instructor. Students are expected to attend all classes. Faculty have the right to assign an "F" or "NC" grade to a student who attends less than 80 percent of the meetings of any course. There are no formally excused absences for any reason, including illness. However, a student who will miss one or two classes may be able to make up missed work, at the discretion of each instructor. If a student will miss one or two classes due to illness, he or she should notify all current faculty members by e-mail. For absences of two or more class meetings due to illness, the student may contact the director of counseling to request a leave of absence.</p>

  <h2>Graduate</h2>
  <p>The following addendum applies to students taking the course for graduate credit.</p>
  <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Demonstrate visual communication skills through the use of graphic illustrations, photography and typography</li>
    <li>Integrate composition and design in support of concept</li>
    <li>Demonstrate the ability to code functional requirements of projects</li>
    <li>Apply critical thinking and needs analysis to concept design and development</li>
  </ul>    
    
  <h3>Content</h3>
  <p>Graduate students should demonstrate an ability to work and learn independently. In addition to the requirements listed in course assignments graduate students should demonstrate an understanding of materials in the course text and outside resources through their work output. Students must show an ability to articulate their design intentions and to analyze and make suggestions about the work of others.</p>

  <h3>Assessment</h3>
  Graduate students should demonstrate:
  <ul>
    <li>The design of web pages that are aesthetic, functional, appropriate to content and targeted at a specific user group.</li>
    <li>Presentation of content within a clear visual hierarchy.</li>
    <li>Organization and grouping of site content into logical and understandable groups.</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h2>Students with Disabilities Statement</h2><p>Massachusetts College of Art and Design is committed to fostering the academic, personal, and professional growth of all our students with a variety of resources for their success.  We are committed to ensuring that students with documented disabilities, as defined under the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), are provided equal access to all campus resources and opportunities.</p>

The Academic Resource Center provides support to all students as well as access to a disability coordinator, academic coaches and writing specialists.</p>
  <p>Please check with the Bookstore about the availability of digital-audio versions of the assigned texts or readings in this course. If they are not available, or if you need additional materials in the digital-audio format, please contact the Academic Resource Center to assist you.  It can take three (3) to four (4) weeks to secure digital-audio materials that are not available through our library network.</p>

  <h2>Grading System</h2>
  <p>Two grading systems are used at the college: Letter grades (A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D, F, Incomplete, W) are given in the following courses: Liberal Arts, Art Education, Fashion Design, Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Animation, Illustration, and Architectural Design, and History of Art   Pass/ No Credit / Incomplete/ W grades are given in the following courses: First year studio courses (Studio Foundation - SFDN), Film/Video, Photography, Studio for Interrelated Media, Fine Arts 2D - Painting, Printmaking, Fine Arts 3D - Ceramics, Fibers, Glass, Jewelry/Metalsmithing, Sculpture</p>

  <h2>Grade Definitions</h2>
  <ul class="grades">
    <li><span class="grade">A</span> Exceptional work in all respects. </li>
    <li><span class="grade">B</span> Above average work, distinguished in certain but not all respects.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">C</span> Average.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">C-</span> Below average</li>
    <li><span class="grade">D</span> Lowest passing grade; individual departments may set standards for the application of "D" grades toward progress in the major.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">F</span> Failing work. No credit is given.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">Pass</span> Work meeting all expectations for successful completion of the course.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">NC</span> No Credit. Work that does not meet the expectations of the course.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">Inc</span> Incomplete. A temporary designation indicating that at least 80% of the course requirements have been met and that the remaining course requirements are expected to be completed, and a permanent designation issued by the subsequent mid-semester. The student is responsible for having an Individual Grade Sheet completed by the appropriate faculty member and filed with the registrar. If the student does not complete the course work, a non-passing grade will be issued after the midpoint of the following semester. </li>
    <li><span class="grade">W</span> Withdrawn from the course. No credit earned. W grades do not appear on the student's transcript.</li>
        
  </ul>
  <p>If a failing grade is received in a required course, students must take the course again and pass it. This rule does not apply to a student who changed majors and who did not pass requirements for a previous concentration.</p>

  <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
  <p>Plagiarism In creative work, plagiarism is the inappropriate and unethical representation of another's work as one's own. In those instances where a significant portion of a creative work is intentionally "appropriated," plagiarism is the failure to note, orally or in writing, the source of the appropriation. In expository or academic writing, whenever your work incorporates someone else's research, images, words, or ideas, you must properly identify the source unless you can reasonably expect knowledgeable people to recognize it. Proper citation gives credit where it is due and enables your readers to locate sources and pursue lines of inquiry raised by your paper. Students who do not comply may be penalized.</p>
