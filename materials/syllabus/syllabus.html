  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>An introduction to the planning, organizing, designing and building of usable, accessible and beautiful web sites using industry-standard design methods and modern, semantic development techniques. Students will be exposed to a user-centered design process that will aid them in balancing aesthetics with user experience and will learn to build their designs for the web using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.
    <em>Prerequisites:</em> CDGD-220.
  </p>

  <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
  <p>This course introduces the planning, organizing, designing and building of websites at a basic level using industry-standard design methods and modern, semantic development techniques.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lead the student through the planning, design and development process of small websites.</li>
    <li>Introduce students to methods of organizing site content into logical groups and categories.</li>
    <li>Convey a basic understanding of modern interface design and principles of usability.</li>
    <li>Showcase best-practices for preparing graphics for the web.</li>

    <li>Introduce CSS to format, position and animate content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Methodologies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lectures introduce the conceptual foundations of web design and usability.</li>
    <li>Demonstration, workshopping and pair programming during class teach and re-enforce programming and design skills.</li>
    <li>Readings support theoretical understanding, build foundations and re-enforce in-class lectures.</li>
    <li>Assignments allow for independent practice of skills.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Course Materials</h2>
  <ul class="course-materials">
    <li class="required"><b>Required:</b> <i>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</i>, Jon Duckett <a class="screenonly" href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189">amazon</a>

  </ul>

  <h2>Grading</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><h3>50% Assignment 1<sup>st</sup> Submission</h3>
      All work is due on time and pushed to GitHub (get assignments from classmates or course website if you miss class). Expect to work at least 5 hours outside of class time per week on readings and assignments. If you need to, spend extra time in the 3rd floor Digital Media Labs. Be prepared to present for class review all homework assignments.
    </li>
    <li><h3>30% Assignment Revisions</h3>
      Programming and web design are processes that benefit from review and revision. Students should be responsive and timely to requests for revisions and suggestions from the teacher. Requests and suggestions will be made in class, via email and via GitHub issues and pull requests. Students should commit to GitHub with meaningful messages.
    </li>
    <li><h3>10% Class Participation</h3>
      Students are expected to participate in every class.
      This includes but is not limited to participating in class conversations, providing feedback during critiques, working respectfully during pair programming.

  <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
  <p>Students in the Graphic Design Department must maintain a minimum C+ average in their required major courses each semester to proceed in the major. Students whom the faculty feel would benefit from a check-in of their progress may receive written notice
    of a mid-semester review for the following semester. This is not a formal review, and no special action is required of students - faculty will write up an evaluation based on the current coursework and performance of the students being reviewed.</p>
  <p>Students who do not achieve a minimum C+ average in their major courses are considered to be on departmental probation. Any course in which a student on departmental probation receives a C or below must be retaken. Due to the sequential nature of the
    Graphic Design program’s courses, this may entail taking a “special program” until the required course in question is offered again the following year. Such a special program will be designed by the chair on a case-by-case basis. If the grades of
    a student on probation fall below a C+ average a second time, the student is subject to dismissal from the program.</p>
  <p>Students at all levels are allowed to repeat a semester or year only once in the program, after which they will be dismissed from the major.</p>
  <p>Reviews in Graphic Design occur twice a year - in December and in May. Review times are posted in the Design Office the week before reviews. Review performance is factored into students’ final course grades by their instructors. Students are required
    to attend their reviews. Lateness of more than 5 minutes beyond the posted review time is considered missing the review. Missing a review without written proof of a medical or family emergency is grounds for failing all required courses.</p>

  <h2>Attendance</h2><p>During the first week of classes, faculty state clearly their expectations for performance and attendance, their method of recording attendance, and their expectations for makeup work and examinations. All students must attend the first day of classes for which they are registered to reserve a place in the course. If a student cannot attend because of illness or other emergency, he or she must email faculty before the first class meeting to inform the faculty member of their absence. A student who misses the first meeting of a class without notice may be dropped from the roster by the instructor. Students are expected to attend all classes. Faculty have the right to assign an "F" or "NC" grade to a student who attends less than 80 percent of the meetings of any course. There are no formally excused absences for any reason, including illness. However, a student who will miss one or two classes may be able to make up missed work, at the discretion of each instructor. If a student will miss one or two classes due to illness, he or she should notify all current faculty members by e-mail. For absences of two or more class meetings due to illness, the student may contact the director of counseling to request a leave of absence.</p>

  <h2>Graduate</h2>
  <p>The following addendum applies to students taking the course for graduate credit.</p>
  <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Demonstrate visual communication skills through the use of graphic illustrations, photography and typography</li>
    <li>Integrate composition and design in support of concept</li>
    <li>Demonstrate the ability to code functional requirements of projects</li>
    <li>Apply critical thinking and needs analysis to concept design and development</li>
  </ul>    
    
  <h3>Content</h3>
  <p>Graduate students should demonstrate an ability to work and learn independently. In addition to the requirements listed in course assignments graduate students should demonstrate an understanding of materials in the course text and outside resources through their work output. Students must show an ability to articulate their design intentions and to analyze and make suggestions about the work of others.</p>

  <h3>Assessment</h3>
  Graduate students should demonstrate:
  <ul>
    <li>The design of web pages that are aesthetic, functional, appropriate to content and targeted at a specific user group.</li>
    <li>Presentation of content within a clear visual hierarchy.</li>
    <li>Organization and grouping of site content into logical and understandable groups.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
  <p>Plagiarism In creative work, plagiarism is the inappropriate and unethical representation of another's work as one's own. In those instances where a significant portion of a creative work is intentionally "appropriated," plagiarism is the failure to note, orally or in writing, the source of the appropriation. In expository or academic writing, whenever your work incorporates someone else's research, images, words, or ideas, you must properly identify the source unless you can reasonably expect knowledgeable people to recognize it. Proper citation gives credit where it is due and enables your readers to locate sources and pursue lines of inquiry raised by your paper. Students who do not comply may be penalized.</p>
