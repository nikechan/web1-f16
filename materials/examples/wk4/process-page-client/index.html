	<h2>Andrew Ringler's Website</h2>
	
	<h3>Client Needs</h3>
	<p>Andrew wants a website for his web design class. He wants to show information about the course such as a syllabus, link to student work and link to course examples.
	</p>
	<p>He also has some unique aesthetic requests. He wants an anchor icon next to the mouse cursor. We should discuss with him the usability of this request, it seems to conflict with his desire for a modern website.
