	<h1>HTML Tags</h1>
	<p>
		Review of HTML tags from last week, and introduction of
		lists and images.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are 6 levels of headings in HTML h1 to h6. Usually we only have one h1 tag
		on our page reserved for the page name.
	</p>
	<h2>2nd level heading</h2>
	<h3>3rd level heading</h3>
	<h4>4th level heading</h4>
	<h5>5th level heading</h5>
	<h6>6th level heading</h6>

	<h2>Lists</h2>
	<p>
		We usually announce every major section of content with a h2 tag.
	</p>
	<h3>Unordered list ul</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Item one</li>
		<li>Item two</li>
		<li>Item three. You can put anything inside a list element. Including links to <a href="http://google.com">google.com</a>, images, header tags.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Ordered list ol</h3>
	<h4>My Top 5 Favorite Colors (in order)</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Green</li>
		<li>Red</li>
		<li>Hot Pink</li>
		<li>Ultraviolet (entire spectrum)</li>
		<li>Dull fuchsia</li>
	</ol>

  <h2>Tables</h2>
  <table>
    <tr> <!-- I am a row -->
      <th>Color</th> <!-- th makes a cell bold -->
      <th>Color Code</th>
      <th>Related Fruits</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Red</td> <!-- I am a cell within a row -->
      <td>#FF0000</td>
      <td>Apple, Beet</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Blue</td>
      <td>#0000FF</td>
      <td>Blueberry, Blue Eggplant</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

	<h2>Images</h2>
  <!-- note that images have no closing tag, this image
        has a relative URL, that is relative to the location of the HTML file that loaded it. An image should always
      have an alt tag that is read by screen-readers and Google (search engines) -->
  <p>
    Shrink your browser window width-wise. Watch how this image will shrink to fill the browser window. This is because we have the max-width: 100% set for img in our CSS.
